            <description><![CDATA[<p>This is one of my first pieces after returning from The
Corning Studios in New York.I cut and polished
a 1” x 3” x 3” piece of deep pink rose quartz.I then bound it to a piece of optical glass (BK7), polished that and
continued until all the sides of the quartz were covered.I used different dyes in the bonding agent to
add color.Once it was all assembled, I began
shaping the piece.At each step of the
process I would watch as the piece evolved, not really knowing where it would
end up.When you’re cold-working glass, it’s
not polished, its translucent at best, so you get a hint of what it will look
like when it is finely ground and ultimately polished, but you don’t really
know.The internal reflections remain
hidden until the very end.And then you
just stare at it, turn it a different way, maybe recut an edge.After completing this particular piece, I
realized why artist are addicted to creating – it’s worth the struggle to get
there – even if no one ever sees it.</p>]]></description>
