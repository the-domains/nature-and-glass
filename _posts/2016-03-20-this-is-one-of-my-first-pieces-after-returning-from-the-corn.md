  This is one of my first pieces after returning from The

  Corning Studios in New York.I cut and polished

  a 1” x 3” x 3” piece of deep pink rose quartz.I then bound it to a piece of
  optical glass (BK7), polished that and

  continued until all the sides of the quartz were covered.I used different dyes
  in the bonding agent to

  add color.Once it was all assembled, I began

  shaping the piece.At each step of the

  process I would watch as the piece evolved, not really knowing where it would

  end up.When you’re cold-working glass, it’s

  not polished, its translucent at best, so you get a hint of what it will look

  like when it is finely ground and ultimately polished, but you don’t really

  know.The internal reflections remain

  hidden until the very end.And then you

  just stare at it, turn it a different way, maybe recut an edge.After completing
  this particular piece, I

  realized why artist are addicted to creating – it’s worth the struggle to get

  there – even if no one ever sees it.

This is one of my first pieces after returning from The
Corning Studios in New York.I cut and polished
a 1" x 3" x 3" piece of deep pink rose quartz.I then bound it to a piece of optical glass (BK7), polished that and
continued until all the sides of the quartz were covered.I used different dyes in the bonding agent to
add color.Once it was all assembled, I began
shaping the piece.At each step of the
process I would watch as the piece evolved, not really knowing where it would
end up.When you're cold-working glass, it's
not polished, its translucent at best, so you get a hint of what it will look
like when it is finely ground and ultimately polished, but you don't really
know.The internal reflections remain
hidden until the very end.And then you
just stare at it, turn it a different way, maybe recut an edge.After completing this particular piece, I
realized why artist are addicted to creating -- it's worth the struggle to get
there -- even if no one ever sees it.

Glass, particularly optical glass like leaded glass or
crystal can clarify, magnify, shrink or distort the image of something real.It also creates different perspectives all in
one piece.I originally had a
professional photographer image my work, but they didn't quite capture the
image I saw, so I keep trying to photograph the pieces, but then I have to
choose one or two to show... ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/39bc3e0b-5731-4c32-af4c-0f9bbd2c5c98.png)

Another thing I enjoy about working with glass is the option
of using transparency, this creates an inner space within the piece, but also
implies an "outer-space" beyond.

I recently viewed the Pablo Picasso exhibit "Paired" at the
Boston Museum of Fine Art.The exhibit
showed several pairs of drawings/paintings similar but different.The noted that Picasso said that a piece is
never finished.This reminded me of this
cube piece which I thought was somehow empty.Several months after looking at this piece I created an accompanying
piece to help define the "outer-space."It seemed to complete the piece for me.
