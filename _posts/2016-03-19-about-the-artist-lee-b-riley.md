**About the artist (lee b riley)**

In my youth I was fascinated with minerals and crystals. I spent my weekends at Houston's Museum of Natural Science and soon acquired my own mineral collection. How could something so perfect occur Naturally? As I aged and acquired more minerals I sought creative ways to display these natural jewels. I found my medium in glass at an art studio in Bethlehem PA - The Banana Factory. Shaping combinations of glass and minerals allows me to express my thoughts or just have fun. 
While many people attribute each gemstone with various mystical properties, I see them as miraculous creations in their own right. The spontaneous existence of natural minerals and gems things gives me hope that anything is possible -- I started thinking of the sculpted pieces as "hope stones" -- an ornament for the home to remind us that hope is real. My recent venture to create "wearable sculptures" is an effort to remind us all to hope throughout the day.
