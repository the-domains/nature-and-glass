Dichroic Cube \# 1;  4" x 4" x 4"; cold-worked

A good friend of mine asked if I could do something in dichroic glass.  Perhaps the best way to do this is with dichroic film and create color bars or to use dichroic in the hot shop and then cold-work it.  However, I had some old pieces of dichroic glass so I started with that.  The cube originally came out OK, but then as I started to play with different angles and make different cuts.   This obviously revealed more light and color.  I had to stop at some point or I would have just continued to shape it until it was gone.  I used the glass lathe to give it some more character with straight cuts and then added some "biologic growth" with the lathe as well.

Same piece, same light, different position.  If you are all stressed out, find a piece like this and just start looking at it.  It's very distracting - maybe I should call it "tranquility block" - lee
